# Will the customer subscribe to a term deposit?
## An analysis of a bank's marketing campaign dataset

 ### Overview

In this investigation, we explore a dataset from a Portuguese banking institution, which is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Our goal is to understand what type of classifier is best able to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit account. We consider the following classifiers:  <b>k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines </b>. As a result of the analysis, we provide to our customer -- the bank -- an optimal classifier to use to predict whether a prospective depositer will subscribe to the product (a term deposit).

### Data Understanding

We visualize the data in tablular form to get familiar it, as follows: 

* View the data and understand the meaning of the various features (columns) of the data
* Identify incomplete data and decide upon a reasonable apporoach to handling such data.
* Get a feel for how closely correlated the features are to each other. This will help us understand if there are redundant features which do not add significantly to data understanding.
